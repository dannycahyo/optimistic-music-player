## Optimistic Music Player

You might be wondering, why do I call it optimisic? Well, it's because I implement model based testing tho hahahaa. Nope, I was joking hehe. This project was created for learning model based testing using XSTATE test.

I choose adopting model based testing for self documenting and easy to maintain tests. And It's way more DRY than regular & imperative tests.

## Available Scripts

`yarn dev`

Run the application

`yarn test`

Run the test

## XSTATE Visualizer
